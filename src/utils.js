    question: "What is React?",
    answer: "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the view when the state of the application changes."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?",
    answer: "`let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are limited to the block they are defined in. `const` is used for values that shouldn't be reassigned, while `let` can be reassigned. `var`, on the other hand, is function-scoped, and can lead to bugs if not used carefully."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of hooks in React?",
    answer: "Hooks are a feature in React that allow functional components to have state and side effects, features that were previously only available in class components. The most commonly used hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a promise in JavaScript?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?",
    answer: "`==` compares values after type coercion (e.g., '5' == 5 will return `true`), while `===` compares both value and type without type coercion (e.g., '5' === 5 will return `false`)."
  },
  {
    question: "What is version control?",
    answer: "Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on the same project. Git is one of the most popular version control systems, often used in combination with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the DOM?",
    answer: "The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that represents the HTML structure of a webpage as a tree of objects. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically update the content of a webpage."
  },
  {
    question: "What are RESTful APIs?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between `map()` and `forEach()` in JavaScript?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is CI/CD in software development?",
    answer: "CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It is a set of practices that aim to streamline the development lifecycle by automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes to production."
